I am a driven and detailed-orientied cybersecurity analyst. I work to indentify potential ricks, thearts and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the integrity, to help safegaurd organizations.

My passion to constantly expand my horizon in cybersecurity and provide tangible value to the people I serve, alongside a team with equal values, drives me to provide the best security posture I can. I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk.
