## My working cybersecurity professional statement

I am a driven and punctual professional that leverages my ability to find and address discrepencies in order to provide value in whatever task I am assigned.  

My passion to constantly expand my horizon in cybersecurity and provide tangible value to the people I serve, alongside a team with equal values, drives me to provide the best security posture I can.
