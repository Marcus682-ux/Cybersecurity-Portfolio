# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.

My passion to constantly expand my horizon in cybersecurity and provide tangible value to the people I serve, alongside a team with equal values, drives me to provide the best security posture I can. I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risk.
